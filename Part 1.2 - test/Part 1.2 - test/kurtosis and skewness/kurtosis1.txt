The kurtosis of eruption duration is -1.5116, which indicates that eruption duration distribution is platykurtic. 
This is consistent with the fact that its histogram is not bell-shaped.
A commonly used measure of kurtosis is given by
K = E(X - µ)4/[E(X - µ)2]2
= fourth moment about mean/square of the second moment
PDFs with values of K less than 3 are called platykurtic (fat or short-tailed),
and those with values greater than 3 are called leptokurtic (slim or longtailed).
A PDF with a kurtosis value of 3 is known as mesokurtic, of which the normal distribution is the prime example.
